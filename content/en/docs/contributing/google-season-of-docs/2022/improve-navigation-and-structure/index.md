# Google Season of Docs 2022 : Proposal - Improve the Navigation and Structure of the cert-manager Website

Right now the content is not designed with our target audiences in mind.
For example a new user will not easily find a guide explaining how to install cert-manager on AWS and configure it for Letâ€™s Encrypt.
Nor will a Cluster Administrator easily find information about how to optimize cert-manager for a large cluster with many Certificates.
The information exists but is spread across multiple pages and is often not at the obvious page.

We would like a technical writer:
1. to help us identify our target audiences and
2. to identify the key tasks of each of these audiences and
3. re-structure the cert-manager.io website with this in mind.

For example, we have discussed the following audiences and tasks: Beginner, Cluster Administrator, User, Integrator, New Contributor
and each of these people will be interested in a different set of tasks.
We would like them to quickly and easily find the information they need.

By making it easier for each group to find the information they need we aim to reduce the number of support queries.

## Measuring success:

After the technical writer has helped us identify the 3 key tasks for each audience
we will measure a baseline number of clicks required to achieve the task and we will aim to minimize the number of clicks for each task.
